# Machine Learning Practical 2 — Jupyter Notebook

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook created as part of a **Machine Learning practical/lab assignment**.  
The notebook focuses on hands-on implementation and analysis of core machine learning concepts.

> ⚠️ **Language note**  
> Some inline comments and explanations inside the notebook are written in **Persian (Farsi)**.  
> However, the **code logic, variable names, equations, and visual outputs follow standard machine learning conventions** and can be understood by non-Persian readers.

- `practical2_403201483.ipynb` — main notebook

## Overview
This notebook emphasizes **practical understanding** of machine learning methods through direct implementation and experimentation.  
Rather than relying solely on high-level libraries, the focus is on understanding how models work internally.

## Topics Covered
Depending on the section, the notebook includes:
- Data preprocessing and visualization
- Implementation of machine learning algorithms
- Model training and evaluation
- Interpretation of results and plots

## Tools & Libraries
- Python 3.9+
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- (Optional) Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

Install required packages:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn jupyter
